🚀 LeetCode Daily Challenge

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Challenge repository!

This repository documents my commitment to solving at least one LeetCode problem every single day and pushing the solution here consistently. The goal is to build strong problem‑solving skills, maintain discipline, and create a transparent learning trail over time.


🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Build daily consistency in Data Structures & Algorithms

Improve logical thinking and problem‑solving skills

Prepare effectively for technical interviews

Maintain a public record of progress

Develop a strong GitHub profile through discipline

This is not about perfection — it’s about showing up every day


Each day contains:

solution.txt → Submitted solution code

README.md → Problem details, approach, and notes


Challenge Rules (Self‑Imposed)

Solve at least one problem daily

Push the solution on the same day

No skipping days

Quality over quantity

Even a small attempt counts — consistency matters


🔥 Motivation

Small daily improvements lead to massive long‑term results.

This repository is proof that growth happens through daily effort, not occasional bursts.


🤝 Contributions

This is a personal challenge, but suggestions, optimizations, and discussions are always welcome!


⭐ Final Note

If you’re also on a LeetCode journey — feel free to fork this repo or start your own daily challenge. Let’s grow together.


Happy Coding! 🚀
